##  **Determinant Calculation** 
-   For 2x2 and 3x3 matrices, use the hardcoded formulae of cofactor expansion
-   For other random shapes, use **LU Decomposition** 

-   The determinant of triangular matrix is simply the product of its diagonal elements. If a matrix can be converted to some composition of a set of triangular matrices, its determinant will also be some composition of the determinants of its constitutent triangular matrices.
-   Through gaussian elimination, with partial pivoting, any square matrix A can be decomposed into 
$$PA = LU$$.
